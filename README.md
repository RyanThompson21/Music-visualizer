# Music-visualizer
this program creates a visual representation of the data collected from a survery, given to students, about music. The simple survery was just asking  whether students had heard and liked a certain song and some demographc information (major, hobby they most enjoy, region they're from). The window displayed shows 9 songs per page with a legend in the bottom right corner. Each song has a bargraph displaying how many students from each demographic heard and liked the song. The songs can be displayed by title, artist name, release year, and genre and the graphs for each demographic can be toggled.
